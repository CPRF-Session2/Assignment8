1. fprintf() and printf() are both functions used in C to print out given
input.  However, they are slightly different.  fprintf() prints input
through a specific stream (FILE) while printf() sends formatted output to
the stdout stream.  Both are of type int, so they technically return an int
when used.  Both printing methods can utilize format specifiers to input
specific data types but generally they are both given string input when no
specifiers are used.

2. Opening a file in "rw" mode indicates that the computer will read from
the file first and then erase and write over the previous text after. This 
mode could be used in a situation in which the user wants to see what was
previously written in the file but then wants to replace all text 
written in the previous file. "wr" mode indicates that the computer will
write over and delete all previous text and then read from the new text 
provided. This mode would be useful if the user wanted to write text and
have it immediately be displayed. Opening a file in "w" mode indicates to
the computer to essentially delete all previous text in whatever file
chosen and to write over whatever was previously written. This mode would
be useful if the user wished to completely delete all previous written 
text. The "a" mode is used to append the previous text and thus will not
delete or write over any previous text but instead will add whatever new
text to the file named.  This would be useful to a user who wished to 
keep whatever text was previously written but wanted to make changes to 
the text, for example if the user was editing an essay.

3. The function gets() should be avoided because the function is not 
passed the length of whatever array or string it is passed and thus 
it can easily overstep array boundaries and cause errors in whatever 
program it is being used in.

4. fp points to whatever file is titled trial on the machine being used.
The function fopen() is used which returns a FILE type and this FILE 
pointer fp is then assigned to "point" to the trial file.
