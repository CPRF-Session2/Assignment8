   fprintf() prints text to whatever output the programmer tells it to, and you can format the input and output.

2. opening in "rw" reads the file first, "wr" overwrites the code and then reads it. "w' mode overwrites the code but "a" only adds to the file.

3.gets() does not know the size of the input so i could overwrite other memory addresses to compensate.

4. It points to nothing.
